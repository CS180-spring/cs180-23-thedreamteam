# GenericDB
GenericDB has a **terminal console interface** that allows users to store and interact with data. Users can communicate through the terminal-based interface to create, add, delete, or modify documents. The system will be able to filter and search through these documents.

  - Users are prompted with the option to interact with the database for as long as they do not quit the program
